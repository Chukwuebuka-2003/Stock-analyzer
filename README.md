# Stock-analyzer.
This program was written entirely in python.

It uses stock data gotten from Yahoo finance API, and extracts important information related to the stock.

It can tell you the fair value of a stock, the margin of safety. These are important when analyzing a stock before making a purchase

Most new investors, might see a stock trending and decide to buy the shares in that trending stock.
What's more effective when investing in a stock, is to calculate the fundamental analysis of that stock. 
Without a proper analysis of a stock, you might buy an overvalued stock and that could lead toa poor returns on investment.

Traditionally stock fundamental analysis weren't automated. Thanks to Python, you can analyze any stock without the stress of analyzing traditionally.

It's an indicator of a company's profitability calculated as revenue minus expenses excluding tax and interest.

# AVERAGE NET INCOME GROWTH RATE


Net income growth shows how rapidly a company has been able to boost its "bottom line." 
Growth investors might look for companies with net income growth of, say, 20% or more.

# COST OF DEBT
The cost of debt is the effective rate that a company pays on its debt, such as bonds and loans. Debt is one part of a company's capital structure, with the other being equity. 
Calculating the cost of debt involves finding the average interest paid on all of a company's debts.

Terminal value is calculated by dividing the last cash flow forecast by the difference between the discount rate and terminal growth rate. 
The terminal value calculation estimates the value of the company after the forecast period.

# FCF (Free cash flow)


Free cash flow per share (FCF) is a measure of a company's financial flexibility that is determined by dividing free cash flow by the total number of shares outstanding.
